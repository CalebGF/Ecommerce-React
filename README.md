# React Shop Webpage

This is a simple React application that displays a list of trending products. The products are loaded from an API and can be filtered by name using the search bar at the top of the page. You can also add products to your cart and checkout using the buttons on each product card.

## Searching for Products

To search for products, simply type a search term into the search bar at the top of the page and press enter. The list of products will be filtered to show only the products that match your search term.

## Adding Products to Your Cart

To add a product to your cart, simply click the "Add to Cart" button on the product card. You can view your cart by clicking the "Cart" button in the top right corner of the page.

## Checking Out

To check out, click the "Checkout" button on the cart page. You'll be taken to a checkout form where you can enter your shipping and payment information. Once you've entered your information, click the "Submit" button to complete your purchase.
